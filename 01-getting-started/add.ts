/*
# Exercise 1: Getting Started with TypeScript

## Task
1. Set up a new TypeScript project (init `tsconfig.json`, add a sample `.ts` file, compile it).
2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Add type annotations.
3. Use an AI tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) to explore alternative ways to write this function. List at least two different solutions and discuss their pros and cons in comments.
