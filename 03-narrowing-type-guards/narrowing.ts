Exercise 3: Type Narrowing and Type Guards in TypeScript

Instructions:
1. Write a function that accepts either a string or a number as its input.
2. Use TypeScript's type narrowing features (like `typeof` or custom type guards)
   to handle each type appropriately:
   - If the input is a string, print its length.
   - If it's a number, print its square.
3. Make sure your function works for both types without errors.

Optional Exploration:
- Try creating your own type guard for a custom object type (like an interface or
  class) and use it in a function.
- Experiment with handling arrays that contain both strings and numbersâ€”how can
  you safely process each element?
