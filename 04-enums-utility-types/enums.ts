/*
Exercise 4: Working with Enums and Utility Types

Instructions:
1. Create an enum to represent the status of an order (for example: Pending, Shipped, Delivered).
2. Write a function that takes a status value and returns a user-friendly string (e.g., "Your order has shipped!").
3. Use a TypeScript utility type (like Partial, Record, or Pick) to create a mapping from each status to its message, and use this mapping inside your function.
4. Make sure your code uses TypeScript’s enum syntax and type annotations.

Optional Exploration:
- Add more statuses to your enum (like Cancelled or Returned) and update your function to handle them.
- Explore using string literal types as an alternative to enums. What are the differences?
- See what happens if you pass an invalid value to your function—how does TypeScript help you catch mistakes?

AI Prompts:
- What are the benefits of using enums instead of plain objects or constants?
- How do utility types like Record or Partial work with enums?
- How does TypeScript help prevent errors when working with enums and utility types?
