/*
Exercise 1: Getting Started with TypeScript

Task:
1. Set up a TypeScript project (init tsconfig, add a .ts file, compile it).
2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Add type annotations.
3. Use an AI tool to explore alternative ways to write this function. Try at least two different solutions and discuss their pros and cons.
*/

function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// Try writing the function in other ways (e.g., arrow function, function expression, etc.)
// Use AI to help you explore different approaches and discuss which you prefer and why.
// Occasionally, try omitting or changing types to see what happens.
