Exercise 2: Working with Objects and Interfaces in TypeScript

Instructions:
1. Create an object that represents a user, with at least a `name` (string) and `age` (number).  
2. Define a TypeScript interface for the user shape, and use it to type your object.  
3. Write a function that takes a user object and returns a formatted string like:  
  "Alice is 30 years old."

Optional Exploration:
- Add more properties to the user (e.g., email, isAdmin) and update the interface and function.
- Try omitting the interface and see how TypeScript infers types.
- Try defining the user shape using both `interface` and `type`â€”what differences do you notice?
- Make some properties optional and handle them in your function.

AI Prompts:
- What happens if I add extra properties to the user object?
- How does TypeScript help prevent mistakes when working with object shapes?
- When should I use an interface vs. a type alias for objects?
