Exercise 1: Writing a Simple Add Function in TypeScript

Instructions:
1. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Use TypeScript type annotations for the parameters and the return value.  
2. Implement this function in three different ways:
  - As a standard function declaration
  - As a function expression
  - As an arrow function

Optional Exploration:
- Try removing or changing the type annotations and see what errors or warnings TypeScript gives you.
- Run `tsc` (the TypeScript compiler) with and without the `--strict` flag to see how type checking changes.
- Bonus: Extend your function to handle string inputs as well, and discuss what changes are needed.

AI Prompts:
- What happens if I leave out the type annotations? How does TypeScript infer the types?
- Which function style is most common in real-world TypeScript projects, and why?
- How can I make my add function safer or more flexible?
