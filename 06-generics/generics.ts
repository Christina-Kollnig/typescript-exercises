Exercise 6: Introduction to Generics in TypeScript

Instructions:
1. Write a generic function called `identity` that takes an argument and
   returns it. Use a type parameter to ensure the function works with any type.
2. Call your `identity` function with different types of arguments (e.g., a
   number, a string, an array) and observe the inferred types.
3. Create a generic interface or type for a container that holds a value of any
   type, and use it to type an object.

Optional Exploration:
- Try constraining your generic type parameter (e.g., to only allow objects with
  a certain property).
- Write a generic function that works with arrays and returns the first element,
  or `undefined` if the array is empty.
- Compare your generic function to one that uses `any`â€”what are the differences
  in type safety?

AI Prompts:
- What are the benefits of using generics over `any` in TypeScript?
- How does TypeScript infer generic types from function arguments?
- When should I use generic constraints, and how do they work?
